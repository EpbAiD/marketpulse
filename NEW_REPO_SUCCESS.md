Some scripts might still reference the old repo name. Update if necessary:

```bash
# Search for old repo references
grep -r "market-regime-forecaster" .
```

### Set Up Daily Automation
Your daily automation (`daily_update.sh`) should work as-is since it uses the git remote origin.

### Update BigQuery (if needed)
If you have any BigQuery tables or scripts that reference the old repo name, update them to "marketpulse".
