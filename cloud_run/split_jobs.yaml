# Split Job Configuration for Parallel Training
# ==============================================
# Divides 22 features into 3 groups for parallel execution.
# Each job can run independently and will skip features already trained.
#
# Usage:
#   # Deploy all 3 jobs
#   ./cloud_run/deploy_split_jobs.sh
#
#   # Or run individually via gcloud
#   gcloud run jobs execute marketpulse-training-batch1 --region us-central1
#   gcloud run jobs execute marketpulse-training-batch2 --region us-central1
#   gcloud run jobs execute marketpulse-training-batch3 --region us-central1
