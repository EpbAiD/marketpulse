### Template 3: Learning Journey

```
🔍 What I learned building a multi-agent forecasting system

3 months ago, I started building MarketPulse - an autonomous market regime predictor.

Here's what I learned about production ML:

1️⃣ Orchestration > Individual Models
   LangGraph coordination was more valuable than model tuning

2️⃣ Automation = Reliability
   Daily runs + self-monitoring = 100% uptime

3️⃣ Simple Features > Complex Models
   31 well-selected features beat 294 engineered ones

Final results:
✅ 98.4% classification accuracy
✅ 2.6% forecast error
✅ 10-day predictions in <50 seconds
